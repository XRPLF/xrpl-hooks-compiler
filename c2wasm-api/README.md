# API that compiles C code to WASM

This repository contains a webserver for a C to WASM compiler and
Language Server (i.e. interactive linting).  Server is built with
[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), fast and low overhead framework
for Node.js

Compiling itself is done with clang, Language Server is clangd
connected over WebSocket.


## Development

If you want to try this project follow these steps:

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:eqlabs/c2wasm-api.git`
- Install JS dependencies by running `yarn` or `yarn install` you can use npm as well
- Install native dependencies (wasi-sdk & clangd) as automated by the docker container construction in https://github.com/eqlabs/xrpl-hooks-compiler and run `yarn dev`; alternatively, just run the docker instance from there

This should start server at port `:9000`, the actual compiling endpoint is this:
[http://localhost:9000/api/build](localhost:9000/api/build)

Endpoint only accepts `HTTP POST`.

You can send for example following payload to endpoint:

```json
{
  "output": "wasm",
  "compress": true,
  "files": [
    {
      "type": "c",
      "name": "file.c",
      "options": "-O3",
      "src": "#include..."
    }
  ]
}
```

Payload itself is quite self-explanatory, but the code you want to compile is under files arrays src property, you can also add some options for the compiler itself. When you POST this payload to the endpoint you should get back following response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Success",
  "output": "eJzUXQecVcXVv21uee/t7iv7...",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "building wasm",
      "console": "",
      "success": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Output contains compiled wasm file base64 encoded.
